# Easy-Settings
Easily add settings functionality to your applications.

### What? & Why?
A simple to use python library to create gui and backend for settings.
Every time I was working on a Gtk application, I had to create my own GUI and connect it to some settings module like configparser.

It is time consuming and often very repetitive.
This library does the work for you AND in very few steps!

### Supported gui libraries
* Gtk

### Supported settings modules
* Configparser
* Json

### TODO
* Add more gui libraries like qt.
* Add gsettings as backend.
